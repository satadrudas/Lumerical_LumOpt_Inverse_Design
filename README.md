# Nanophotonic_Inverse_Design

## Overview
To design nanohotonic devices using inverse design method.<br />
I have used Lumerical's [LumOpt](https://github.com/chriskeraly/lumopt/tree/release) to design a 3dB directional coupler.<br /><br/>

TODO:<br/>
Phase injected topology optimization for directional coupler.<br />
